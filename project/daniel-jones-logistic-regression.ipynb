    "#### Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting a subset of the KDD 99 datasets original features presents a number of advantages. When running intrusion detection systems within the internal network of an organisation, the system should be running and identifying threats in real-time. To do this, it needs to record, store and process the organisations traffic in a short time frame. Removing features known to be noisy and irrelevant should allow a higher percentage of network activity to be recorded, reduce the storage cost, and speed up the classification algorithm [5]. \n",

    "  - $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix of the M eigenvalues, \n",
    "  - and U is a matrix of M eigenvectors in columns [8]\n",
