    "  1. Does the ratio of normal and bad connections need to be similar in the training and testing data? If so, we should use stratified testing.\n",
    "    - Unless you include all types in the training set, the model won't necessarily be able to distinguish between the classes. Further, if we sample the incorrect ratio of classes in our training and testing sets, we have the potential to bias the model against rare classes.\n",
    "  2. Should we consider k-fold validation?\n",
    "    - What do we think? Yes: it helps to protect against overfitting of the data [^ref???] and allows us to better measure how our model will perform against unseen data.\n",
    "    - This is quick to implement, but would require each of us to write our models in such a way that they are repeatable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**TODO:** If our models perform well, we should consider doing a quick test at the end with new data (from the non-10percent data set). This was mentioned as a potential think to do in the assessment spec:\n",

    "    \n",
    "Perform 10-fold cross-validation on the data, generating the `train_test_splits` variable mapping a training and testing set to each experiment. This process splits the data into ten bins (stratified to ensure a similar ratio of `normal` and `bad` connections in each group), then creates ten combinations of nine bins of training data to one bin of testing data. These are configured in such a way that each of the ten bins is used for testing at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, we have ensured that every single data point has been left out of training and tested against. This should help protect against overfitting of data, and allows us to better measure how our model will perform against unseen data. Further, by doing this ten times, we have lowered the potential for \"lucky dips\" when randomly sampling training and test data sets (in contrast to the leave-one-out methodology).\n",
    "\n",
    "When splitting data into training and testing sets, it is important to consider the ratio's of different classes. In our case, around $20\\%$ of our connection events are classified as `normal` (with the resr being classified as `bad`). We should also consider whether having unbalanced class ratios could have an effect on either the model, or our performance metrics.

This looks particularly good, and makes a good point: our class ratio's do not reflect real world data. (I would imagine) that the vast majority of traffic experienced by an companies internal network is going to be `normal`. Our data set is the opposite (20% normal). Does this have the potential to affect our performance?\n",

    "In real-world scenarios we will often want our classification system to work in real-time, identifying threats as soon as possible after they happen. Reducing the number of features has the potential to speed up the execution time of our classification algorithms, allowing new threats to be found and acted upon promptly.\n",
